# ThreeDGraph
This page shows the mapping of the complex number z to the complex number w according to w = z^2 + Bz + C. The sliders let one control the real and imaginary parts of the coefficients B and C. The location in the horizontal plane represents z. The height of the surface represents the real part of w. The color represents the imaginary part of w. The "switch" button makes the height the imaginary part of w and the color representative of the real part.
